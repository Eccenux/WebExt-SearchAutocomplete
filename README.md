#  WebExtension: SearchAutocomplete

This WebExtension aims to give you quick, keyword based autocomplete for your search engines. Making your address bar an effective tool again ;-). Should be a good replacement for Omnibar add-on (that worked until FF 56).

For now this gives you English Wikipedia autocomplete. Goal is to allow you to define your own search engines... In the mean time you can fork this extension to customize it to your needs.
